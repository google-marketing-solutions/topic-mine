# Topic Mine

This program automates various tasks related to Google Ads campaigns and trends generation. It utilizes the Google Ads API, Google Sheets, BigQuery, and other services to streamline keyword management, trend analysis, and data integration.

Features:
1. Headlines, descriptions and keywords generation given a list of products or brands and (optionally) their descriptions.
2. Headlines, descriptions and keywords generation given a list of products or brands and trends if there is a relationship between them (meaning if the product or brand is trendy).
3. Data integration with Google Sheets.
4. Data integration with BigQuery.
5. Data integration with Merchant Center via BigQuery.
6. Data integration with Search Scout via BigQuery.
7. Data integration with Google Trends via BigQuery.
8. Data integration with RSS Feeds (pending).

## Introduction

This program is designed to help automate tasks related to Google Ads campaigns and trends analysis. It provides several functionalities, including keyword management, data integration with Google Sheets, and copies generation. It is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Prerequisites

Have a Google Cloud Platform project with a billing account and the following GCP APIs enabled:

1. Generative Language API
2. Google Ads API
3. Google Sheets API
4. BigQuery API

## Getting Started

Before using this program, you will need to configure it with your specific credentials and settings. Here are the initial steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up `config.json` file
3. Run `deploy.sh` script
4. Share the spreadsheet(s) that are going to be used with the newly-created service account with edit permission (more details below)

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains important settings and credentials required for the program to function. You must duplicate the file `config.json.example`, rename it to `config.json` and then edit this file to include your specific information. Here is an example of the `config.json` file:

```json
{
    "advertiser": "Company or brand name.",
    "project_id": "Google Cloud Platform proyect id to deploy Topic Mine.",
    "project_region": "Google Cloud Platform proyect id to retrieve data from - e.g.: us-central1.",
    "client_id": "Your client id - see Authentication params below.",
    "client_secret": "Your client secret - see Authentication params below.",
    "refresh_token": "Your refresh token - see Authentication params below.",
    "login_customer_id": "Your Google Ads customer id - see Authentication params below.",
    "google_ads_developer_token": "Your Google Ads developer token - see Authentication params below.",
    "gemini_api_token": "Your Gemini API token - see Authentication params below.",
    "cloud_run_service": "Cloud run service name to be created, e.g: topic-mine.",
    "service_account_name": "GCP service account name to be created, e.g: topic-mine-service-account.",
    "language": "Language to generate content. Supported values: ES, EN, PT.",
    "country": "Country for which the ads are for. E.g.: Mexico.",
}
```

### Authentication params

client_id and client_secret: Google Cloud console -> APIs & Services -> Credentials -> + Create credentials -> OAuth Client ID -> Desktop app

refresh_token:
1. Download credentials file generated in previous step
2. Rename it `creds.json` and paste inside `refresh_token_generator` folder
3. Run `refresh_token_generator.py`
4. Open url shown in terminal and follow steps
5. Once allowed permission, a site unreachable will appear in the web browser. Do not close it, copy the full url from the browser
6. Paste url in terminal and hit enter
7. Refresh token will be provided

login_customer_id: Usually at the top right of Google Ads console with a format similar to XXX-XXX-XXXX. Copy without dashes or hyphens.

google_ads_developer_token: Follow instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token)

gemini_api_token: Follow instructions [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### [Optional] Prompts configuration

In the `/prompts/examples` directory, there are example prompt files. By default, Topic Mine will behave as if you are a retailer, so retailer-oriented prompts will be used. This can be changed by using one of the prompt files from the provided examples, or creating one of your own.

**Example**: If you are a university, you might want to copy the file `/prompts/examples/prompts_es.py.universities`, paste it and rename to `/prompts/prompts_es.py` (note the directory change from `/prompts/examples` to `/prompts`)

**Note**: If you want to use custom prompts you can do it, but beware that the return format must be explicitly and clearly specified in them.
**Note 2**: To add additional information to the prompts (for example, custom info related to the products), you can adapt the prompts accordingly and then you will need to adapt the part of the code that uses the prompts. That code is located in `/services/content_generator_service.py`, in the method called `__get_copy_generation_prompt`.


## Deployment

To deploy project, first set up the `config.json` file and then run the `deploy.sh` script.
**Important note:** once the project is deployed, share the spreadsheet(s) that are going to be used with the newly-created service account with edit permission.

### [Optional] Create a recurring job with Cloud Scheduler

Once deployed, you can create a job with Cloud Scheduler to run Topic Mine periodically. Steps:

1. Go to Cloud Scheduler and create new job.
2. In "Define the schedule": set name, frequency and timezone.
3. In "Configure the execution":
- **Target type**: HTTP
- **URL**: The one printed when running the `deploy.sh` script (can also be found in the new Cloud Run service) followed by de endpoint you want to use (e.g.: `https://topic-mine-xxx.a.run.app/content?...`)
- **HTTP method**: POST
- **HTTP headers**: The one that says "Content-Type" must have value "application/json" (if it doesn't show up, save the job and open edit mode again)
- **Body**: The body of the request (see details below)
- **Auth header**: Add OIDC token
- Service account:** The one created when deploying Topic Mine (set in file `config.json`)
- **Audience**: Same URL as before but without the endpoint resource (e.g.: `https://topic-mine-xxx.a.run.app/`)
4. In "Configure optional settings": set the attempt deadline to something longer (e.g.: 30m) so that the job does not fail when Topic Mine is still running
