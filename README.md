# Bardtrender

This program automates various tasks related to Google Ads campaigns and trends generation. It utilizes the Google Ads API, Google Sheets, BigQuery, and other services to streamline keyword management, trend analysis, and data integration.

So far, it has two running modes: Client trends and Google trends. In Client trends mode, it will generate ad copies and keywords given the trends the client has registered on their site. In Google trends mode, it will check the latest trends from Google Search, try to match them with the brands or products that the client sells, and then create ad copies and keywords for those that do match.

```json
"keywords": {
        "language_code": /* Language to generate (e.g., "1003") */,

    }
```
## Deployment

To deploy project, first set up the `config.json` file and then run the `deploy.sh` script.

### [Optional] Create a recurring job with Cloud Scheduler

Once deployed, you can create a job with Cloud Scheduler to run Bardtrender periodically. Steps:

First configure the service account to have permission to run the service:
1. Go to IAM & Admin -> IAM
2. Identify the service account created when deploying Bardtrender (set in file `config.json`) and click the edit button on the right
3. Add the role "Cloud Run Invoker" and save changes

Then create the job and use that service account:
1. Go to Cloud Scheduler and create new job. 
2. In "Define the schedule": set name, frequency and timezone.
3. In "Configure the execution":
- Target type: HTTP
- URL: The one printed when running the `deploy.sh` script (can also be found in the new Cloud Run service) followed by de endpoint you want to use (e.g.: `https://bardtrender-xxx.a.run.app/trends/client/generate`)
- HTTP method: GET
- Auth header: Add OIDC token
- Service account: The one created when deploying Bardtrender (set in file `config.json`)
- Audience: Same URL as before but without the endpoint resource (e.g.: `https://bardtrender-xxx.a.run.app/`)
4. In "Configure optional settings": set the attempt deadline to something longer (e.g.: 30m) so that the job does not fail when Bardtrender is still running
